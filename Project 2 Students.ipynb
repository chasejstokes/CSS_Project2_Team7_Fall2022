The rate of diabetes does not increase nor decrease signficantly with this attribute. The chart above shows a straight line of fit, likely due in part to the even spread of gender between counties. Regardless of the reason, the variables relating to gender will likely not be strong predictors for the rate of diabetes in a given county."

    "As shown above, the LASSO model selected has reduced all the coefficients to 0. This means that the predicted value is the same every time. So, we must have selected a lambda value which is too high (i.e., the model default of `alpha = 1.0` is too high). To fix this, we bring in the `LassoCV()` function to select better values of alpha through cross-validation."

    "Through cross-validation on the validation data sets, we were able to find the best alpha value, around 0.004. This is far from the default value of 1 and likely indicates that the LASSO model adds little to a regular `LinearRegression()`. This now serves to help us with relevant feature selection, as LASSO performs feature selection as part of the modeling process. Rather than have no features to choose from, the adjustment to alpha allows us to determine key features which contribute to the predictive ability of the model.\n",
