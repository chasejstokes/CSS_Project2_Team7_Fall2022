The rate of diabetes does not increase nor decrease signficantly with this attribute. The chart above shows a straight line of fit, likely due in part to the even spread of gender between counties. Regardless of the reason, the variables relating to gender will likely not be strong predictors for the rate of diabetes in a given county."
