Additionally, inactivity appears to also correlate with these variables. From the figure, we can see that in counties with high rates of obesity and diabetes also tend to have high rates of inactivity. Taken together, we should expect that both obesity and inactivity will be important predictors of a county's rate of diabetes"

The rate of diabetes does not increase nor decrease signficantly with this attribute. The chart above shows a straight line of fit, likely due in part to the even spread of gender between counties. Regardless of the reason, the variables relating to gender will likely not be strong predictors for the rate of diabetes in a given county."

So, we must have selected a lambda value which is too high (i.e., the model default of `alpha = 1.0` is too high). To fix this, we bring in the `LassoCV()` function to select better values of alpha through cross-validation."

This is far from the default value of 1 and likely indicates that the LASSO model adds little to a regular `LinearRegression()`. This now serves to help us with relevant feature selection, as LASSO performs feature selection as part of the modeling process. Rather than have no features to choose from, the adjustment to alpha allows us to determine key features which contribute to the predictive ability of the model.\n",
